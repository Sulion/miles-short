# Miles short
This project is yet another URL-shortener written as a test assignment.

The name of the project playfully reflects its purpose (to make any URL _'only'_ miles short) and also is a 
tribute to the Bujold's character Miles Vorkosigan, which is a very energetic persona,
but, as the URLs after the application's done with it, is quite short and perhaps a little ugly.
